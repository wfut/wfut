Weapons Factory Unreal Tournament

Weapons Factory Unreal Tournament (WFUT) is a class-based mod for the original Unreal Tournament. It is a port of the popular (back in the day) Weapons Factory mod for Quake 2 and Quake 3, which was in turn inspired by Team Fortress. WFUT has 10 classes, lots of new weapons, and a number of custom maps.

Development of the mod occurred from 2000 to 2002, and then stopped due to real life taking precedence for the team. In 2014, Ob1 and I decided piece things together and upload it to Github as open source with the hope that someone may find it useful.

TODO: document a quick "getting started" section.
